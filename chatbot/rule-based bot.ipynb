        "\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        " - Create the simple_chatbot function. This function takes user input, matches it with the predefined rules using regular expressions, and returns appropriate responses based on the patterns defined earlier.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "-  Implement the interactive conversation function and the conversation loop. This section allows users to interact with the chatbot. It includes the logic for exiting the conversation, restarting, and handling different user inputs within the conversation loop."
